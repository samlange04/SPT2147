This file contains details of what is denoted on images included in these folders.

Units
-- Important units note: deflections and potential have an incorrect unit on the colorbar. The correct unit should be ...
-- Data signal is in MJy/Sr -  that is 10^6 Jansky per Steradian.
-- x/y positions are given in arcseconds.

Lenses
-- SPT2147-50: Source Redshift = 3.7602, Lens Redshift = 0.845
-- SPT0418-47: Source Redshift = 4.2248, Lens Redshift = 0.263

Visual Aids
-- 'x' and '+' symbols mark the centres of mass and light profiles respectively.
    Most of these are therefore at the origin. Those which are not denote the position of the fit subhalo (in SPT2147).
-- Black lines drawn around the lens onto e.g. model images are the lensing critical curves.
-- The outer circular border of the image is the mask we apply to reduce the number of pixels being ray-traced (smaller mask = faster runtime).
    The radius of this mask for SPT2147 is 2.6" (centred on (0.2, 0.0)), and for SPT0418 is 3.0" (centred on (0.0, 0.0)).
